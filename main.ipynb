    "The model uses Employee Attrition dataset from Kaggle's and compares the effectiveness between using Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and Random Forest. We start by analyzing the dataset, keeping the significant ones and removing the uncorrelated ones to optimize performance from our models. Then we proceed to parsing, splitting, and normalizing before training our models. Below are explanations to our work and our code."

    "\n",
    "We start with all the data given from the dataset. The raw dataset has 1470 rows and 35 features including Attrition, which is our desired output feature. In terms of data types, there are 26 numerical features and 9 categorical features, ranging from 2 to 6 categories each.\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge for our particular dataset is the significant imbalance of the dataset. There are ~83% 'no' responses to attrition, which means we need to employ different techniques to resolve this issue. Namely, we used SMOTE to oversample the minority class, and used ROC AUC to evaluate our model's performance, which is a better metric than accuracy when the dataset is skewed."

    "Neural networks, particularly multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), are powerful tools for modeling complex patterns in data. Their ability to learn non-linear relationships makes them well-suited for predicting employee attrition, where patterns may be influenced by various interconnected factors such as employee demographics, job satisfaction, and performance metrics. In this approach, we use sklearn's ```MLPClassifier``` to implement a neural network, implementing techniques such as data preprocessing, oversampling with SMOTE to address class imbalance, and model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. The model is trained and validated on a stratified split dataset, ensuring balanced representation of classes in each split."

    "The baseline accuracy is also produced for comparison. Because we have a high imbalance of data (~83% 'no'), our baseline accuracy is very high.\n",

    "However, because of our imbalanced dataset, the ROC AUC is a better indication of how well our model is doing. The ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. The area under the ROC curve represents how well the model can distinguish between classes across all possible thresholds:\n",
    "* A value of 1.0 indicates perfect classification.\n",
    "* A value of 0.5 indicates random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the ROC AUC score evaluates the model's performance across all possible thresholds, not just a single threshold (like accuracy does). This ensures a more comprehensive view of the model's ability to separate classes. Unlike accuracy, which can be skewed by the majority class, the ROC AUC score remains a solid metric because it evaluates the ranking of predictions (how well the model separates positive and negative classes) rather than absolute predictions."
